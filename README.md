favicon wasn't reloading because it was cached, adding '?v=1.1' to the end so that it's like href="favicon.ico?v=1.1" fixed it by forcing it to update

- need break statements after switch cases because you can have multiple cases associated with the same block
```js
case 'A':
case 'B':
case 'C':
    doSomething();
    break;

case 'D':
case 'E':
    doSomethingElse();
    break;
```
